# AI Practice 2 - Clustering and Classification

This project contains an academic exercise focused on implementing machine learning algorithms such as **K-Means** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** using Python. It was developed as part of a university course in Artificial Intelligence.

## 🧠 Features

- Implementation of K-Means clustering
- Implementation of KNN classification
- Data labeling and preprocessing (`my_labeling.py`)
- Documentation and presentation included

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for testing)

## 📂 Files

- `Kmeans.py`: Unsupervised clustering using K-Means
- `KNN.py`: Supervised classification using KNN
- `my_labeling.py`: Custom labeling logic for input data
- `Informe IA.pdf`: Full project report
